## Predictive Models in Aiding Disaster Recovery

In my final project for SYS 6018, I trained a variety of supervised and unsupervised classification models to color data, representing aerial imagery from the 2010 Haitian earthquake. The goal of this project is to refine and train the best model possible - alongside using the best data transformations possible - to identify the location of blue tarps in Haiti, designating the location of earthquake survivors.

Analysis and visualization done in R.
